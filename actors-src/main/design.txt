Main function
=============

Strings together the data-acqusition parts and the parallel reduction parts to
calculate and display the final result (average age of actors in movies that are
currenlty in theaters)

   - Input:
      NT - number of threads for the parallel reduction

   - Output:
      None (void)

   * For simplicity sake, I will probably just print out the average age on the command line,
     and as a stretch goal, I will calculate average age by movie
