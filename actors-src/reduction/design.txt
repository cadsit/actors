Parallelized Style Reduction
============================

   - Inputs: 
      1. the number of threads desired
      2. a list of records, each holding at least:
         1) an actor's name
         2) the movie in theaters they are performing in

   - Outputs: a list of records, holding:
      1. the name of a movie currently in theaters
      2. the total count of actors processed for that movie
      3. the combined age of all the actors processed

   - Process:
      1. Divide the list of actors into NT equally sized chunks
      2. Spawn threads which repeat over their chunk:
         a) research an actor online, finding their age
         b) add their age into a list of 
      3. When all threads are done, combine the lists, aggregating
         necessary information

   * NT = number of threads

   - Potential problems
      1. Double counting actors appearing in more than one movie
      2. How to handle missing information
